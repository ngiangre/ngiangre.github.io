    "text": "Hello! This is exciting for a couple of reasons:\n\nThis is the redesign of my original website\nThis redesigned website is made using Quarto\nThis redesigned website is now hosting my digital garden\n\n\nMy digital garden is like a virtual showcase\nIn Buffalo, I learned that there’s an annual garden walk, where people all over the city can venture through and see wonderful gardens carefully crafted and skillfully maintained by their gardeners. These gardens are open to the public and showcase plants and outdoor designs serving as inspiration and just very nice places to experience.\nSimilar to a real garden, I want to craft a digital garden. My digital garden will be carefully crafted to showcase new and old projects, both matured content and content in development. What makes this digital garden deviate from my profile on Github is that 1) it is organized as a mixture of long-term, project work and short-term, stand-alone posts, and 2) it is meant as sort of an “official” landing page from my personal website.\nI acknowledge how my digital garden will deviate from a digital knowledge tree or mind map, as described in this article about the ethos. However, I really like the idea of thinking-out-loud and sharing knowledge and resources openly. So here we are.\n\n\nI will make an effort to work on my digital garden like a gardener tends to their garden in the backyard\nCurrently, alot of the work in my garden is projects from my time as a graduate student. I’m very proud of the work I contributed to and the open access work. After my time as a graduate student, there’s still so muc to explore and to work on! Obviously I won’t have a ton of time to devote to personal projects; besides work and family, I also need to catch up to my partner on the Marvel universe on Disney+…But when I can I will be definitely working more on growing existing work and knowledge in an effort to think-out-loud and develop as a scientist.\n\n\nHow Quarto is fantastic software for making your digital garden\nI wanted to give my original website a face-lift. It was my first foray into web development, even if extremely basic. I knew I would have to do it eventually, but I wasn’t keen on any particular tool out there. I wanted 1) customization but also ease-of-use, 2) community support for tool development so I wouldn’t be stuck with broken code later, 3) a way to do coding in different languages and frameworks so my projects are only limited by content and not technology, and 4) I wanted ti use a tool that would persist a long time.\nQuarto seemed to fit these criteria as a new tool, support by a community, offering amazing customization and a friendly user-interface, and it fit my projects with code from different languages. I also searched for some other cool features (see the typing text on my homepage) that I could implement using Quarto. The site is also pretty mobile friendly which is a must these days! The tool seems to be great for putting together my digital garden.\nHere’s hoping we all get to see some cool content result from ‘tending’ to my digital garden!"

    "text": "One of the research questions during my PhD was can we generate evidence before a heart transplant for proteins in blood to predict heart failure within 24 hours after the transplant? Ideally, the clinical team wanted an equation that would provide a probability of heart failure for a patient. Another requirement for this equation was that it would generalize to patients across heart clinics, such as in the US or Europe, and outperform existing clinical scores. This question was what motivated developing the algorithm Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV)*.*The algorithm is not new, but in late 2016 I wasn’t familiar with an open source implementation for the question and I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn python.\nFast forward 5 years, 2 papers were published where we used MCCV and found pre-transplant predictive evidence for plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) towards post-transplant heart failure1,2. The algorithm MCCV was written as a few python functions in scripts for both papers3,4. At the time of publishing the papers, I knew I would eventually incorporate the functions into a package to make the algorithm more widely available*. That time came after publishing the papers and after I defended my PhD thesis. Serendipitously, the software Quarto, which was announced by Posit, allowed making a website AND interchangeably write python and R code in the same document. Quarto allowed showcasing the algorithm in both programming languages (with prettier visualizations from R) along with tutorials and detailed explanations.*Also I wrote the python package for the opportunity to code in python since I mostly code in R for work.\nThe mccv python package is available on GitHub and is also shown on a website* written in Quarto. The website includes several tutorials in the navigation bar at the top of the page.*https://ngiangre.github.io/mccv/ or https://mccv.nickg.bio\nThank you for reading this post! Reply in the comments if you find the algorithm useful in your own work. I also want to give a shoutout to the Quarto team for developing a great communication tool. I highly recommend having an accompanying website for analytical software packages (luckily, this is easier for developing R packages with the {pkgdown} package])!\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.

I’m interested to evaluate montelukast and Psychiatric disorders having larger signal at a particular stage. Here’s my visualizations to attempt to evaluate this:\n\nmontelukast_drug_info <- tbl(con,\"drug\") %>%\ncollect() %>%\nfilter(grepl(\"montelukast\",atc_concept_name))\n\npsych_disorder_ids <- tbl(con,\"event\") %>%\ncollect() %>%\nfilter(grepl(\"Psych\",meddra_concept_name_4)) %>%\npluck('meddra_concept_id')\n\npos <- \n    position_dodge2(width=0.1)\n\ntbl(con,\"ade_nichd\") %>% \n    filter(atc_concept_id==!!pluck(montelukast_drug_info,\"atc_concept_id\") &\n               meddra_concept_id %in% !!psych_disorder_ids) %>% \n    collect() %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd))\n    ) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(nichd,gam_score_90mse)) +\n    geom_violin() +\n    geom_point(pch=21,size=0.2,\n               position = pos) +\n    geom_line(aes(group=ade),alpha=0.1,\n              position = pos) +\n    geom_point(\n        data=tbl(con,\"ade_null\") %>% \n            collect(),\n        aes(nichd,null_99),\n        size=3,color=\"red\",\n               position = pos) +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45,vjust=1,hjust=1)\n    ) +\n    labs(x=\"\",y=\"90% lower dGAM signal\",caption = \"99% null dGAM in red\")\n\n\n\nprobs <- seq(0,1,0.01)\ntbl(con,\"ade_nichd\") %>% \n    filter(atc_concept_id==!!pluck(montelukast_drug_info,\"atc_concept_id\") &\n               meddra_concept_id %in% !!psych_disorder_ids) %>% \n    collect() %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd))\n    ) %>% \n    group_by(nichd) %>% \n    summarise(q = list(probs),\n              qs = \n                  list(quantile(gam_score_90mse,probs = probs))\n              ) %>% \n    unnest(c(\"qs\",\"q\")) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(nichd,q,fill=qs)) +\n    geom_tile() +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent,\n                       breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6)) +\n    scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"purple\",\n                         midpoint = 1,high = \"red\") +\n    labs(y=\"Signal Percentile in stage\",x=\"\") +\n    guides(fill=guide_colorbar(title=\"dGAM lower\\n90% CI signal\")) +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45,vjust=1,hjust=1)\n    )\n\n\n\nprobs <- seq(0.8,1,0.01)\ntbl(con,\"ade_nichd\") %>% \n    filter(atc_concept_id==!!pluck(montelukast_drug_info,\"atc_concept_id\") &\n               meddra_concept_id %in% !!psych_disorder_ids) %>% \n    collect() %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd))\n    ) %>% \n    group_by(nichd) %>% \n    summarise(q = list(probs),\n              qs = \n                  list(quantile(gam_score_90mse,probs = probs))\n              ) %>% \n    unnest(c(\"qs\",\"q\")) %>% \n    left_join(\n        tbl(con,\"ade_null\") %>% \n            collect(),\n        by=\"nichd\"\n    ) %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd)),\n        above_null_99 = qs>null_99\n    ) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(nichd,q,fill=above_null_99)) +\n    geom_tile() +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent,\n                       breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6)) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\",direction = -1) +\n    labs(y=\"Signal Percentile in stage\",x=\"\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45,vjust=1,hjust=1)\n    )\n\n\n\n\nFrom these, we can see how there are large, outlier scores for montelukast induced Psychiatric disorders at the toddler stage. The score distributions are similar across toddler and childhood stages, though. Nevertheless, the last graph shows that the signals in the toddler stage are above the null 99% scores in a larger proportion of the signal distribution. So empirically, we do see that montelukast-induced Psychiatric disorders are more likely (i.e. have larger, nonrandom signal) at the toddler stage of child development.\nSince the last graph is the most definitive graph showing localization of non-random signal for this systematic disorder, we can create the graph for all montelukast-induced systematic disorders in order to evaluate non-random signal at stages:\n\ndisorders <- \n    tbl(con,\"event\") %>%\n    collect() %>% \n    pull(meddra_concept_name_4) %>% \n    na.omit() %>% \n    unique()\n\npos <- \n    position_dodge2(width=0.1)\nprobs <- seq(0.8,1,0.01)\ncolors <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3,\"Set1\")[1:2]\nnames(colors) <- c(\"TRUE\",\"FALSE\")\n\ng_objs <- lapply(disorders,function(disorder){\n    disorder_ids <- \n    tbl(con,\"event\") %>%\n    collect() %>%\n    filter(meddra_concept_name_4==disorder) %>%\n    pluck('meddra_concept_id')\n    \n    tbl(con,\"ade_nichd\") %>% \n    filter(atc_concept_id==!!pluck(montelukast_drug_info,\"atc_concept_id\") &\n               meddra_concept_id %in% !!disorder_ids) %>% \n    collect() %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd))\n    ) %>% \n    group_by(nichd) %>% \n    summarise(q = list(probs),\n              qs = \n                  list(quantile(gam_score_90mse,probs = probs))\n              ) %>% \n    unnest(c(\"qs\",\"q\")) %>% \n    left_join(\n        tbl(con,\"ade_null\") %>% \n            collect(),\n        by=\"nichd\"\n    ) %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd)),\n        above_null_99 = qs>null_99\n    ) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(nichd,q,fill=above_null_99)) +\n    geom_tile(show.legend = F) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent,\n                       breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values=colors) +\n    labs(y=\"\",x=\"\",title=\"\",subtitle=disorder) +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()\n    )\n})\n\nnames(g_objs) <- disorders\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(plotlist=g_objs,ncol = 5)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that few systematic disorders had higher-than-the-null signal at stages. Psychiatric disorders do seem to be uniquely induced in toddlers by montelukast.\n\nkidsides::disconnect_sqlite_db(con)"

This downloaded a full dataset. So seems like I can use this package to start reading in and playing with full datasets. I can also use the API to make smaller requests based on filters, too. Tis will be better in the long run since I don’t want to have to download entire datasets. But maybe I will once and store using {arrow} so a web app or notebook doesn’t make a lot of API calls. We shall see how this journey unfolds!\nHope this train of thought is useful to you readers! I’ll definitely come back to this."

    "text": "One of the main research questions during my PhD was how does the biology of childhood interact with medications taken during by children? After years of research and reading the literature my thesis became:\n\nAdverse drug reactions manifest from the interaction between drug exposure and dynamic biological processes during child growth and development.\n\nTo investigate, we generated thousands of statistical signals of the interaction between pediatric population drug reporting and the child development stage resulting in an adverse event1. For more details the reference is freely available at this reference1.The statistical model we used was a generalized additive model with this basic specification g(E(Adverse reaction)) = spline(stage, by = Drug)\nThe {kidsides} R data package makes this database more accessible by caching the SQLite database on your machine. You can read up more regarding installation at the website https://kidsides.nickg.bio. Additionally, there is an overview on the data within the database at this vignette, and a tutorial on extracting smaller, more manageable datasets in this vignette.Fair warning, R 4.0 and above is required; and the entire database is almost 1 GB\nYour main questions about {kidsides} may be what data do the tables have and what kind of graphics could I make? In this post, I want to\n\nGive a preview of all 17 tables in the SQLite database.\nShow how the strength of the hypothesized interactions depending on the class of a medication, such as cardiovascular or psychiatric drug class.

However, tools to predict adverse events in pediatric patients currently do not take into account these dynamics. My PhD advisor, Nicholas Tatonetti, and I developed a pharmacovigilance signal-detection algorithm to identify dynamic adverse events (such as metabolic and psychiatric disorders). We developed a database and a web application that provides the first resource to identify and evaluate drug safety signals across child-development stages.
