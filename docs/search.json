    "text": "Hello! This is exciting for a couple of reasons:\n\nThis is the redesign of my original website\nThis redesigned website is made using Quarto\nThis redesigned website is now hosting my digital garden\n\n\nMy digital garden is like a virtual showcase\nIn Buffalo, I learned that there’s an annual garden walk, where people all over the city can venture through and see wonderful gardens carefully crafted and skillfully maintained by their gardeners. These gardens are open to the public and showcase plants and outdoor designs serving as inspiration and just very nice places to experience.\nSimilar to a real garden, I want to craft a digital garden. My digital garden will be carefully crafted to showcase new and old projects, both matured content and content in development. What makes this digital garden deviate from my profile on Github is that 1) it is organized as a mixture of long-term, project work and short-term, stand-alone posts, and 2) it is meant as sort of an “official” landing page from my personal website.\nI acknowledge how my digital garden will deviate from a digital knowledge tree or mind map, as described in this article about the ethos. However, I really like the idea of thinking-out-loud and sharing knowledge and resources openly. So here we are.\n\n\nI will make an effort to work on my digital garden like a gardener tends to their garden in the backyard\nCurrently, alot of the work in my garden is projects from my time as a graduate student. I’m very proud of the work I contributed to and the open access work. After my time as a graduate student, there’s still so muc to explore and to work on! Obviously I won’t have a ton of time to devote to personal projects; besides work and family, I also need to catch up to my partner on the Marvel universe on Disney+…But when I can I will be definitely working more on growing existing work and knowledge in an effort to think-out-loud and develop as a scientist.\n\n\nHow Quarto is fantastic software for making your digital garden\nI wanted to give my original website a face-lift. It was my first foray into web development, even if extremely basic. I knew I would have to do it eventually, but I wasn’t keen on any particular tool out there. I wanted 1) customization but also ease-of-use, 2) community support for tool development so I wouldn’t be stuck with broken code later, 3) a way to do coding in different languages and frameworks so my projects are only limited by content and not technology, and 4) I wanted ti use a tool that would persist a long time.\nQuarto seemed to fit these criteria as a new tool, support by a community, offering amazing customization and a friendly user-interface, and it fit my projects with code from different languages. I also searched for some other cool features (see the typing text on my homepage) that I could implement using Quarto. The site is also pretty mobile friendly which is a must these days! The tool seems to be great for putting together my digital garden.\nHere’s hoping we all get to see some cool content result from ‘tending’ to my digital garden!"

    "text": "One of the research questions during my PhD was can we generate evidence before a heart transplant for proteins in blood to predict heart failure within 24 hours after the transplant? Ideally, the clinical team wanted an equation that would provide a probability of heart failure for a patient. Another requirement for this equation was that it would generalize to patients across heart clinics, such as in the US or Europe, and outperform existing clinical scores. This question was what motivated developing the algorithm Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV)*.*The algorithm is not new, but in late 2016 I wasn’t familiar with an open source implementation for the question and I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn python.\nFast forward 5 years, 2 papers were published where we used MCCV and found pre-transplant predictive evidence for plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) towards post-transplant heart failure1,2. The algorithm MCCV was written as a few python functions in scripts for both papers3,4. At the time of publishing the papers, I knew I would eventually incorporate the functions into a package to make the algorithm more widely available*. That time came after publishing the papers and after I defended my PhD thesis. Serendipitously, the software Quarto, which was announced by Posit, allowed making a website AND interchangeably write python and R code in the same document. Quarto allowed showcasing the algorithm in both programming languages (with prettier visualizations from R) along with tutorials and detailed explanations.*Also I wrote the python package for the opportunity to code in python since I mostly code in R for work.\nThe mccv python package is available on GitHub and is also shown on a website* written in Quarto. The website includes several tutorials in the navigation bar at the top of the page.*https://ngiangre.github.io/mccv/ or https://mccv.nickg.bio\nThank you for reading this post! Reply in the comments if you find the algorithm useful in your own work. I also want to give a shoutout to the Quarto team for developing a great communication tool. I highly recommend having an accompanying website for analytical software packages (luckily, this is easier for developing R packages with the {pkgdown} package])!\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.

The score distributions are similar across toddler and childhood stages, though. Nevertheless, the last graph shows that the signals in the toddler stage are above the null 99% scores in a larger proportion of the signal distribution. So empirically, we do see that montelukast-induced Psychiatric disorders are more likely (i.e. have larger, nonrandom signal) at the toddler stage of child development.\nSince the last graph is the most definitive graph showing localization of non-random signal for this systematic disorder, we can create the graph for all montelukast-induced systematic disorders in order to evaluate non-random signal at stages:\n\ndisorders <- \n    tbl(con,\"event\") %>%\n    collect() %>% \n    pull(meddra_concept_name_4) %>% \n    na.omit() %>% \n    unique()\n\npos <- \n    position_dodge2(width=0.1)\nprobs <- seq(0.8,1,0.01)\ncolors <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3,\"Set1\")[1:2]\nnames(colors) <- c(\"TRUE\",\"FALSE\")\n\ng_objs <- lapply(disorders,function(disorder){\n    disorder_ids <- \n    tbl(con,\"event\") %>%\n    collect() %>%\n    filter(meddra_concept_name_4==disorder) %>%\n    pluck('meddra_concept_id')\n    \n    tbl(con,\"ade_nichd\") %>% \n    filter(atc_concept_id==!!pluck(montelukast_drug_info,\"atc_concept_id\") &\n               meddra_concept_id %in% !!disorder_ids) %>% \n    collect() %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd))\n    ) %>% \n    group_by(nichd) %>% \n    summarise(q = list(probs),\n              qs = \n                  list(quantile(gam_score_90mse,probs = probs))\n              ) %>% \n    unnest(c(\"qs\",\"q\")) %>% \n    left_join(\n        tbl(con,\"ade_null\") %>% \n            collect(),\n        by=\"nichd\"\n    ) %>% \n    mutate(\n        nichd = factor(nichd,levels=unique(nichd)),\n        above_null_99 = qs>null_99\n    ) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(nichd,q,fill=above_null_99)) +\n    geom_tile(show.legend = F) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent,\n                       breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values=colors) +\n    labs(y=\"\",x=\"\",title=\"\",subtitle=disorder) +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()\n    )\n})\n\nnames(g_objs) <- disorders\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(plotlist=g_objs,ncol = 5)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that few systematic disorders had higher-than-the-null signal at stages. Psychiatric disorders do seem to be uniquely induced in toddlers by montelukast.\n\nkidsides::disconnect_sqlite_db(con)"

Well, I said to her let’s see what the data says!\nSo I ventured out into the world wide web and found a dataset called:\nBaby Names: Beginning 2007\n\nNew York State (NYS) Baby Names are aggregated and displayed by the year, county, or borough where the mother resided as stated on a New York State or New York City (NYC) birth certificate.

We should revise this so county (and also first_name) are in one type of case such as title case:\n\nbaby_names_transformed <- \n    baby_names_transformed %>% \n    mutate(\n        first_name = as.character(first_name) %>% stringr::str_to_title() %>% factor(),\n        county = as.character(county) %>% stringr::str_to_title() %>% factor()\n    )\n\nbaby_names_transformed %>% summary()\n\n      year        first_name            county          sex       \n Min.   :2007   Emma   :  528   Kings      :10672   Male  :46737  \n 1st Qu.:2010   Olivia :  503   Suffolk    : 8164   Female:41162  \n Median :2014   Logan  :  488   Nassau     : 7352                 \n Mean   :2013   Mason  :  475   Queens     : 7244                 \n 3rd Qu.:2017   Liam   :  471   Westchester: 5844                 \n Max.   :2020   Jacob  :  465   Erie       : 5382                 \n                (Other):84969   (Other)    :43241                 \n   name_count    \n Min.   :  5.00  \n 1st Qu.:  6.00  \n Median : 11.00  \n Mean   : 17.77  \n 3rd Qu.: 19.00  \n Max.   :297.00  \n                 \n\n\n\n\n\nMy next data quality question is how many names have data each year?\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))\n\nbaby_names_transformed %>% \n    summarize(n_years = n_distinct(year),.by=c(first_name)) %>% \n    summarize(n_names = n_distinct(first_name),.by=n_years) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(n_years,n_names)) +\n    geom_bar(color=\"black\",fill = \"gray80\",stat = \"identity\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(14)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0.1),\n                       trans=\"sqrt\",breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(10)) +\n    labs(x=\"Year Data: Number of Years With Name Count Data\",\n         y=\"Number of Names With Year Data\",\n         title=\"Many Baby Names Don't Have Counts In A Year\",\n         subtitle=\"Every Name has Count Data For Atleast One Year\") +\n    theme(\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color=\"gray75\"),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother question is are there many names that are unisex i.e. male and female names?\n\ntmp <- \n    baby_names_transformed %>% \n    summarize(n_sex = n_distinct(sex),\n              unisex = n_sex==2,onesex = n_sex==1,\n              .by=c(first_name)) %>% \n    summarize(`Unisex` = sum(unisex),`One Sex`=sum(onesex))\n\ntmp %>% \n    pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %>% \n    mutate(label = glue::glue(\"{name} (N={scales::comma(value)})\")) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(factor(1),value,fill=label)) +\n    geom_bar(stat=\"identity\",position = \"fill\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n    guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL)) +\n    labs(x=NULL,y=\"Percent of Names\",title=\"Most Baby Names Are Gender-Specific\",subtitle = \"There Are A Few Names That Are Unisex, However\") +\n    theme(\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"top\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy last data quality question is how many baby names have data across counties?\n\nbaby_names_transformed %>% \n    summarise(n_counties = n_distinct(county),.by=first_name) %>% \n    bind_cols(\n        summarise(baby_names,total_counties = n_distinct(county))\n    ) %>% \n    mutate(\n        freq_counties = n_counties / total_counties\n    ) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(freq_counties,y=after_stat(count))) +\n    geom_density(bw=\"nrd\",color=\"blue\",fill=\"cornflowerblue\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n    scale_y_sqrt(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(15)) +\n    labs(x=\"Percent of Counties\",y=\"Number of Names With County Data\",\n         title=\"Most Names are Counted in a Few NYS Counties\") +\n    theme(\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color=\"gray75\"),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\nAfter transforming the dataset and checking data quality, we see that:\n\nBaby names are sparsely annotated across counties\nBaby names are, generally, specific to a year or are observed across all years\nThere are a few baby names that are not gender-specific.\n\n\n\n\nI want to ask the question what are the trending baby names in NYS? My question is not specific to the gender or county. Also, my question wants to consider all the baby names in the dataset as possible influencing factors in which baby names are trending. Because of the missing count data, we should use a model to estimate the trend based on the available data. The model we will use is a generalized additive model (GAM) to predict the Poisson distribution count of the baby name. **I heavily referenced https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2021/02/02/random-effects-in-gams/\n\n\n\nLet’s do a small example first. My subquestion is, is the baby name Charlotte trending over time irrespective of other factors?\n\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\nLoading required package: nlme\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'nlme'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    collapse\n\n\nThis is mgcv 1.8-42. For overview type 'help(\"mgcv-package\")'.\n\ntmp <- \n    baby_names_transformed %>% \n    filter(first_name==\"Charlotte\")\n\nform <- as.formula(glue::glue(\"name_count ~ s(year) + county:year\"))\nfit <- mgcv::gam(form,\n                family=\"poisson\",\n                data=tmp,method = \"GACV.Cp\")\n\ntmp %>% \n    bind_cols(.pred = fit$fitted.values) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(name_count,.pred)) +\n    geom_point(shape=21) +\n    geom_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x',method=\"lm\") +\n    labs(x=\"Annotated Counts\",y=\"Predicted Counts\",title=\"Model Predictions Look Pretty Accurate With Not Much Bias\")\n\n\n\ncoefs_ <- fit$coefficients[str_detect(names(fit$coefficients),\"s\\\\(year\\\\)\")] %>% unname()\ntibble(\n    year = seq_along(coefs_),\n    coef = coefs_\n) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(year,coef)) +\n    geom_line(linewidth=2) +\n    labs(x=\"Time\",y=\"Weight\",title=\"Charlotte is predicted as falling in and out of fashion\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to consider all names, we need to specify the name as a random effect and the trend line as a random slope between the name and the year:\n\n(form <- as.formula(glue::glue(\"name_count ~ s(first_name, bs = 're') + s(first_name, year, bs = 're') + county:year + sex:year\")))\n\nname_count ~ s(first_name, bs = \"re\") + s(first_name, year, bs = \"re\") + \n    county:year + sex:year\n\n\nWe can use this formula in our model to get the trends of the baby names over time (Note: we switch from gam to bam so that we can fit the model faster using method = ‘fREML’):\n\ntmp <- \n    baby_names_transformed\n\nif(file.exists(paste0(here::here(),\"baby_name_gam_full.rds\"))){\n    fit <- readr::read_rds(paste0(here::here(),\"baby_name_gam_full.rds\"))\n}else{\n    system.time(fit <- mgcv::bam(form,\n                 family = \"poisson\",\n                 data = tmp,\n                 discrete = TRUE))\n    readr::write_rds(fit,paste0(here::here(),\"baby_name_gam_full.rds\"))\n}\n\nNow we combine the predicted baby name counts to the original data:\n\n(data_pred <- \n        bind_cols(tmp,\n                  as.data.frame(predict(fit,\n                                        new_data = tmp,\n                                        se.fit = TRUE))) %>% \n        tibble())\n\n# A tibble: 87,899 × 7\n

can now plot predicted baby name trends over time:\n\npred_baby_names <- \n    data_pred %>% \n    summarize(avg_pred = mean(fit),.by=c(first_name,year))\n\npred_baby_names %>% \n    ggplot(aes(year,avg_pred,group=first_name)) +\n    geom_line(show.legend = F,color=\"gray80\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(14)) +\n    labs(x=\"Year\",y=\"Average

element_line(color=\"gray95\"),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\nNow we have trend estimates for baby names over time considering the naming variability across counties, gender, and years.\n\n\n\nWe can now ask the question what are the top trending baby names in NY?\n\n(top_10_baby_names <- \n    pred_baby_names %>% \n    summarise(cor =

Along thhe way, I hope to learn more about APIs, Shiny development, and knowledge about the place I call home.\nLet’s get started!\nI first made an account with Tyler Data and Insights. Not sure why, but I may learn why later on.\nSecond, I searched for datasets and sorted by most accessed datasets.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of search filter and sorted site\n\n\nAnd after scrolling through a few pages, I’m curious to look at the Active Corporations dataset.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Active Corporations dataset webpage\n\n\nLuckily, this dataset has a few options to access the data:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of API options\n\n\nAnd below is some information about the dataset on the webpage. It has 3.6 million rows and 30 columns.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Active Corporations dataset description\n\n\nLet’s see what happens when I try to view this dataset.\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\njobj <- jsonlite::read_json(\"https://data.ny.gov/resource/n9v6-gdp6.json\",simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\njobj %>% dplyr::glimpse()\n\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 30\n$ dos_id                     <chr> \"4072354\", \"6221345\", \"4265810\", \"1330171\",…\n$ current_entity_name        <chr> \"GRACE SEAFOOD CORP.\", \"KV CATALYST IM, LLC…\n$ initial_dos_filing_date    <chr> \"2011-03-24T00:00:00.000\", \"2021-07-15T00:0…\n$ county                     <chr> \"Bronx\", \"New York\", \"Queens\", \"Cayuga\", \"B…\n$ jurisdiction               <chr> \"New York\", \"Delaware\", \"New York\", \"New Yo…\n$ entity_type                <chr> \"DOMESTIC BUSINESS CORPORATION\", \"FOREIGN L…\n$ dos_process_name           <chr> \"GRACE SEAFOOD CORP.\", \"KV CATALYST IM, LLC…\n$ dos_process_address_1      <chr> \"1226 EAST 183RD STREET\", \"2373 BROADWAY, A…\n$ dos_process_city           <chr> \"BRONX\", \"NEW YORK\", \"MIDDLE VILLAGE\", \"AUB…\n$ dos_process_state          <chr> \"NY\", \"NY\", \"NY\", \"NY\", \"NY\", \"NY\", \"NY\", \"…\n$ dos_process_zip            <chr> \"10453\", \"10024\", \"11379\", \"13021\", \"10467\"…\n$ chairman_name              <chr> NA, NA, NA, \"GARY J.

Hmmm. It looks like I can export the button by pressing the ‘Export’ button, but I don’t want to have datasets on my laptop. I rather load them into my environment as needed by whatever I would end up developing. Maybe I need to read these SODA docs that are linked on the site.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of SODA Getting Started docs\n\n\nSo it seems like I need to use some extra parameter filtering?

I will create one in my profile settings - this must be why my previous self made the account earlier on in this post. Huzzah! So now that I created an app token, let’s try using it.

This downloaded a full dataset. So seems like I can use this package to start reading in and playing with full datasets. I can also use the API to make smaller requests based on filters, too. Tis will be better in the long run since I don’t want to have to download entire datasets. But maybe I will once and store using {arrow} so a web app or notebook doesn’t make a lot of API calls. We shall see how this journey unfolds!\nHope this train of thought is useful to you readers! I’ll definitely come back to this."

    "text": "One of the main research questions during my PhD was how does the biology of childhood interact with medications taken during by children? After years of research and reading the literature my thesis became:\n\nAdverse drug reactions manifest from the interaction between drug exposure and dynamic biological processes during child growth and development.\n\nTo investigate, we generated thousands of statistical signals of the interaction between pediatric population drug reporting and the child development stage resulting in an adverse event1. For more details the reference is freely available at this reference1.The statistical model we used was a generalized additive model with this basic specification g(E(Adverse reaction)) = spline(stage, by = Drug)\nThe {kidsides} R data package makes this database more accessible by caching the SQLite database on your machine. You can read up more regarding installation at the website https://kidsides.nickg.bio. Additionally, there is an overview on the data within the database at this vignette, and a tutorial on extracting smaller, more manageable datasets in this vignette.Fair warning, R 4.0 and above is required; and the entire database is almost 1 GB\nYour main questions about {kidsides} may be what data do the tables have and what kind of graphics could I make? In this post, I want to\n\nGive a preview of all 17 tables in the SQLite database.\nShow how the strength of the hypothesized interactions depending on the class of a medication, such as cardiovascular or psychiatric drug class.

    "text": "Drug safety in children can be affected by a number of dynamic variables such as enzymatic activity and hormonal levels that change during child growth and development. However, tools to predict adverse events in pediatric patients currently do not take into account these dynamics. My PhD advisor, Nicholas Tatonetti, and I developed a pharmacovigilance signal-detection algorithm to identify dynamic adverse events (such as metabolic and psychiatric disorders). We developed a database and a web application that provides the first resource to identify and evaluate drug safety signals across child-development stages.
