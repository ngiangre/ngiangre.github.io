##### **This site serves to be a platform for me both personally (less-so) and professionally (more-so).** 
  
  <br></br>
  
##### **I'm still getting the hang of this so bear with me! I'm adding more content soon. It's hard to figure out what exactly to put up here...if you happen to stumble upon this site and have some ideas for me let me know!**
  
<br>

##### **Outside of doing research in my [lab](tatonettilab.org), I really enjoy being involved in [AI-related](https://www.meetup.com/AI-at-CUMC/) and [programming](https://nyhackr.org) groups in NYC-they're really fun!**

<br>

##### **I really enjoy listening to podcasts! If you want to suggest me some other great podcasts shoot me an email. Weekly, I listen to (a select few from top to bottom in my Podcasts app):**

* **The Effort Report**
* **Partially Derivative**
* **Talking Machines**
* **Linear Digressions**
* **Data Skeptic**
* **The Inquiry**
* **OPTIMIZE with Brian Johnson**
* **STEM-Talk**
* **Beautiful Anonymous**
* **Freakonomics Radio**
* **Philosophize This!**

<br>

##### **I'm also interested in rehabilitative science. Being [disabled](http://www.wgrz.com/life/wny-native-continues-recovery-from-stroke/244046774) myself, I learn a lot about how the body re-learns movement patterns through [occupational therapy](http://www.nyp.org/rehabmed/services/occupational-therapy) and [pilates](http://www.kinectedcenter.com).**
