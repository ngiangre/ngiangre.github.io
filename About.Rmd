# **I'm still getting the hang of this so bear with me! I'm adding more content soon. It's hard to figure out what exactly to put up here...if you happen to stumble upon this site and have some ideas for me let me know!**

# **Outside of doing research in my [lab](tatonettilab.org), I really enjoy being involved in [AI-related](https://www.meetup.com/AI-at-CUMC/) and [programming](https://nyhackr.org) groups in NYC-they're really fun!**

# **I'm also interested in rehabilitative science. Being [disabled](http://www.wgrz.com/life/wny-native-continues-recovery-from-stroke/244046774) myself, I learn a lot about how the body re-learns movement patterns through [occupational therapy](http://www.nyp.org/rehabmed/services/occupational-therapy) and [pilates](http://www.kinectedcenter.com).**
