My PhD thesis work led to multiple publications including a database of pediatric-specific adverse drug effect signals aligning with dynamic physiological processes during child development. I led the data science efforts to develop an interpretable and robust machine learning algorithm that led to hypothesized biological mechanism for a fatal, idiopathic graft dysfunction after heart transplant surgery.\n\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\bibentry{peddb}\n  \\item \\bibentry{pedreview}\n  \\item \\bibentry{kks}\n  \\item \\bibentry{klkb1}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\n# Positions and Honors {-}\n\n## Positions and Employment {-}\n\n\n\\begin{datetbl}\n2023-- & Computer Science Advisor, MindArch Health \\\\\n2021-- & Quantitative Translational Scientist, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals \\\\\n2016--2021 & Systems Biologist, Columbia University \\\\\n2014--2019 & Cancer Bioinformatician, NHGRI \\\\\n\\end{datetbl}\n\n\n\n## Other Experience and Professional Memberships {-}\n\n\n\n\\begin{datetbl}\n2018--2018 & Bioinformatican, Genetic Leap \\\\\n2021--2021 & Bioinformatician, DNAnexus \\\\\n\\end{datetbl}\n\n\n\n## Honors {-}\n\n\n\n\\begin{datetbl}\n2018--2018 & Outstanding Contribution to Methodological Research at OHDSI symposium \\\\\n2022--2022 & Travel Award to AMIA conference \\\\\n\\end{datetbl}\n\n\n\n# Contribution to Science {-}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item Side effects are significant safety concerns in pediatric drug treatment but are rarely captured during clinical trials and are severely underreported post-market. Moreover, variations in metabolism and physiology as children grow and develop complicate detection of drug safety signals across child development. We developed a novel machine learning approach for identifying ontogenic-mediated adverse event mechanisms. We then made a database of 500,000 drug safety signals, called KidSIDES, freely available and browsable by a web application.\n\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\bibentry{peddb}\n  \\item \\bibentry{pedsim}\n  \\item \\bibentry{pedreview}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\n\\item Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of early mortality after heart transplant. Pre-transplant predictors of PGD remain elusive and its etiology remains unclear. A novel, patented machine learning algorithm identified pre-transplant level of KLKB1 is a robust predictor of post-transplant PGD. Our algorithm enabled the hypothesis that upregulation of coagulation cascade components of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and downregulation of kininogen prior to transplant were associated with survival after transplant.\n\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\bibentry{kks}\n  \\item \\bibentry{klkb1}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n<!--\nCan include additional contributions like the ones above, starting each with\n\\item, followed by a short description, follwed by a chunk using \n`make_numbered_citations`.
