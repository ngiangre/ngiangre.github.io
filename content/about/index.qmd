**Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹**

</p>

<p>**I am a data science enthusiast, life-long learner, and student of
life. Currently, I work as a (remote) Quantitative Translational
Scientist at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Previously, I was a Systems
Biology PhD student at Columbia University in New York City. My homebase
is Buffalo, New York, where, as a native of the "All America City", I am
paradoxically indifferent to snow and a very cold person ðŸ˜¬. Outside of
work, I enjoy spending time with my family, my partner, and carving out
time for my hobbies. I'm also interested in rehabilitative science. As
[a stroke
survivor](https://www.wgrz.com/article/life/wny-native-continues-recovery-from-stroke/244046774),
I like learning about how the body re-learns movement patterns through
[pilates](http://www.koppelemethod.com/).**</p>
