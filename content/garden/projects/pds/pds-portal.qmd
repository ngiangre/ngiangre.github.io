Drug side effects in children were mined from openFDA, the publicly available repository of the FDA. This is the first resource of 460,837 adverse drug events (ADEs) with estimated risk across child development stages. This R shinydashboard application is the publicly accessible web application of this resource. See the publication for more details:
