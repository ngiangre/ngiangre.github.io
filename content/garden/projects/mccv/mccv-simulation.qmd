The motivation for this study is to compare MCCV and traditional hypothesis testing, such as the t-test, as methods for learning outcomes from varied biomarker distributions. The work is being implemented in a collection of notebooks in the github repository. The evaluation results and presentation is being made as Reavel.js slides.
