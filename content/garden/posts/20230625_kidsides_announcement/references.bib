  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Adverse drug effects (ADEs) in children are common
               and may result in disability and death, necessitating
               post-marketing monitoring of their use. Evaluating drug safety
               is especially challenging in children due to the processes of
               growth and maturation, which can alter how children respond to
               treatment. Current drug safety-signal-detection methods do not
               account for these dynamics. METHODS: We recently developed a
               method called disproportionality generalized additive models
               (dGAMs) to better identify safety signals for drugs across
               child-development stages. FINDINGS: We used dGAMs on a database
               of 264,453 pediatric adverse-event reports and found 19,438 ADEs
               signals associated with development and validated these signals
               against a small reference set of pediatric ADEs. Using our
               approach, we can hypothesize on the ontogenic dynamics of ADE
               signals, such as that montelukast-induced psychiatric disorders
               appear most significant in the second year of life.
               Additionally, we integrated pediatric enzyme expression data and
               found that pharmacogenes with dynamic childhood expression, such
               as CYP2C18 and CYP27B1, are associated with pediatric ADEs.
               CONCLUSIONS: We curated KidSIDES, a database of pediatric drug
               safety signals, for the research community and developed the
               Pediatric Drug Safety portal (PDSportal) to facilitate
               evaluation of drug safety signals across childhood growth and
               development. FUNDING: This study was supported by grants from
               the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",
