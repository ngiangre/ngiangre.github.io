⚠️ Short, Technical Post Alert ⚠️

I'm starting to read the book Deep Learning with R.[I've been meaning to read this since I had this book signed at rstudio::conf(2022)]{.aside} I will be putting some code snippets from my reading at the below github repository. What I've learned so far:

1.  You can use {renv} to set, record, and manage a python virtualenv.
2.  It is very simple to get started with NN models using {keras}.
3.  You can use {reticulate} to bring predictions from python objects into R dataframes for visualization using {ggplot2}!
