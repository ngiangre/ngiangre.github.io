  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause
               of early mortality after heart transplant. Pre-transplant
               predictors of PGD remain elusive and its etiology remains
               unclear. METHODS: Microvesicles were isolated from 88
               pre-transplant serum samples and underwent proteomic evaluation
               using TMT mass spectrometry. Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV)
               was used to predict the occurrence of severe PGD after
               transplant using recipient pre-transplant clinical
               characteristics and serum microvesicle proteomic data. Putative
               biological functions and pathways were assessed using gene set
               enrichment analysis (GSEA) within the MCCV prediction
               methodology. RESULTS: Using our MCCV prediction methodology,
               decreased levels of plasma kallikrein (KLKB1), a critical
               regulator of the kinin-kallikrein system, was the most
               predictive factor identified for PGD (AUROC 0.6444 [0.6293,
               0.6655]; odds 0.1959 [0.0592, 0.3663]. Furthermore, a predictive
               panel combining KLKB1 with inotrope therapy achieved peak
               performance (AUROC 0.7181 [0.7020, 0.7372]) across and within
               (AUROCs of 0.66-0.78) each cohort. A classifier utilizing KLKB1
               and inotrope therapy outperforms existing composite scores by
               more than 50 percent. The diagnostic utility of the classifier
               was validated on 65 consecutive transplant patients, resulting
               in an AUROC of 0.71 and a negative predictive value of
               0.92-0.96. Differential expression analysis revealed a
               enrichment in inflammatory and immune pathways prior to PGD.
               CONCLUSIONS: Pre-transplant level of KLKB1 is a robust predictor
               of post-transplant PGD. The combination with pre-transplant
               inotrope therapy enhances the prediction of PGD compared to
               pre-transplant KLKB1 levels alone and the resulting classifier
               equation validates within a prospective validation cohort.

               pre-transplant proteomic signature predictive of PGD.",

  abstract  = "Heart transplantation remains the definitive treatment for end
               stage heart failure. Because availability is limited, risk
               stratification of candidates is crucial for optimizing both
               organ allocations and transplant outcomes. Here we utilize
               proteomics prior to transplant to identify new biomarkers that
               predict post-transplant survival in a multi-institutional
               cohort. Microvesicles were isolated from serum samples and
               underwent proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry. Monte
               Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) was used to predict survival after
               transplant incorporating select recipient pre-transplant
               clinical characteristics and serum microvesicle proteomic data.
               We identified six protein markers with prediction performance
               above AUROC of 0.6, including Prothrombin (F2), anti-plasmin
               (SERPINF2), Factor IX, carboxypeptidase 2 (CPB2), HGF activator
               (HGFAC) and low molecular weight kininogen (LK). No clinical
               characteristics demonstrated an AUROC > 0.6. Putative biological
               functions and pathways were assessed using gene set enrichment
               analysis (GSEA). Differential expression analysis identified
               enriched pathways prior to transplant that were associated with
               post-transplant survival including activation of platelets and
               the coagulation pathway prior to transplant. Specifically,
               upregulation of coagulation cascade components of the
               kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and downregulation of kininogen
               prior to transplant were associated with survival after
               transplant. Further prospective studies are warranted to
               determine if alterations in the KKS contributes to overall
               post-transplant survival.",
