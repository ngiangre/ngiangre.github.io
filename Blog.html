            We had another successful Hackathon at CUMC this weekend-you can read about it at our club's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cumcdatasciencegroup/Blog">google site</a>! Though it was a small group, we made progress on personal projects, including planning for developing a programmable robot!

We decided to switch platforms to allow for inclusive collaboration among members i.e. they can edit the site however is useful. I'm very pleased to see how our community is continuing to grow and reshape to better serve the CUMC graduate student community.

        <h2>Introduction to Bayesian Thinking</i></h2>

            I've been reading about bayesian thinking recently, which means assessing the chances of a given view of the world based on the data you observe from the world. I've decided to make notebooks along with me learning about this topic, especially after reading <i>Think Bayes</i> by Allen Downey (great book btw!). Here's the <a href="https://github.com/ngiangre/thinkbayes/blob/master/ntbk/Dice_walkthrough.ipynb">link</a> to the first notebook on this journey. I hope to be expanding and making more notebooks corresponding to this topic. It's definitely helping me to understand how to think like a bayesian and conduct a very simple example initially. Hope you find it useful!

            This <a href="_posts/ngiangre/r_for_data_science_solutions.html"><i>R for Data Science</i></a> solutions was produced through a study group with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-baik-0718a1134/">Jason Baik</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. Thank you to the <a href="https://nyhackr.org/">New York Open Statistical Programming MeetUp</a> for letting us use a private repository and slack channel while completing this. I wanted to do this for two reason: 1) was to get an overview of the tidyverse and associated packages, and 2) was to provide a solutions guide that fully matches with the chapter numbers and exercises. Feel free to use this while you are reading <i>R for Data Science</i> as well as modify or expand the Rmarkdown file to add your solutions and correct my mistakes (though I fully recognize I heavily relied on <a href="https://jrnold.github.io/e4qf/">Jeffrey Arnold's</a> solutions).
